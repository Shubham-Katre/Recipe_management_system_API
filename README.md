## Data Flow

1. The user sends a request to the application through the API endpoints.
2. The API receives the request and sends it to the appropriate controller method.
3. The controller method makes a call to the method in service class.

4. The method in service class builds logic and retrieves or modifies data from the database, which is in turn given to controller class.
5. The controller method returns a response to the API.
6. The API sends the response back to the user.

## üìùProject Summary

The recipe management system is a RESTful API built with Spring Boot and MySQL. It allows users to store, manage, and search recipes. Users can perform CRUD operations on recipes, including adding, updating, and deleting recipes. Annotation-based validation ensures data integrity. The API also supports commenting on recipes. Users can search for recipes based on various criteria, such as recipe Id. The project follows a controller-service-repository architecture, providing a modular and maintainable codebase. It offers a user-friendly and efficient solution for recipe management and sharing.
